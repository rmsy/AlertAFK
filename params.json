Please feel free to [suggest changes](https://github.com/rmsy/AlertAFK/pulls) if you think something\r\ncould be better - in fact, I encourage you to. (What fun is open-source,\r\ncommunity-driven software if only one person is writing it?)\r\n\r\nAlertAFK is entirely [open-source](https://github.com/rmsy/AlertAFK), and is licensed under the GNU\r\nGeneral Public License version 3. Here’s what that means for you:\r\n\r\n* Feel free to do **whatever you want** with AlertAFK\r\n* Feel free to share AlertAFK with **whoever you want**\r\nbut:\r\n* Don’t sell it.\r\n* Don’t license anything using AlertAFK with a more restricting license.\r\n\r\n**I believe in open software, and I believe in freedom of information.\r\nLet’s use it responsibly and be an example to the world.**\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis is the usage for toggling AFK:\r\n\r\n```/<command> [optional AFK message]```\r\n\r\nThat’s it. These are the commands:\r\n\r\n* /afk\r\n* /a\r\n* /away\r\n\r\nThis is the usage for setting aliases:\r\n\r\n```/alias <add/del/list/clear> [alias]```\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nThere are currently only two values that you need to worry about in AlertAFK’s configuration file.\r\nThere is **broadcastGlobally**, defaulting to false, which defines\r\nwhether or not to broadcast to the entire server when a user goes AFK or\r\nbecomes available again, and **defaultAfkMessage**, which is the default\r\nAFK message to be provided, should the user not provide one. User-defined aliases are also stored in the configuration file, and can be modified from the configuration file, but are primarily modified from in-game. The\r\nconfiguration file will be generated on first-run, you do not need to\r\ncreate it manually.\r\n\r\n**Note:** AlertAFK makes use of Hidendra’s [Griefcraft Metrics](http://metrics.griefcraft.com/). These\r\nstatistics are entirely anonymous, and do not affect performance in any\r\nway. **These statistics help me to get an idea of who’s using AlertAFK\r\nand how, but I respect your right to privacy - should you wish to\r\ndisable these usage statistics, please opt-out in the\r\nPluginMetrics/config.yml file, generated on first-run.**\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Latest version\r\n1.1, CB 1.4.5-R1.0","google":"","name":"AlertAFK"}
