{"body":"# AlertAFK\r\n### What is AlertAFK?\r\n**AlertAFK allows players to designate themselves as AFK, so that other players talking to them in chat are notified that they are not available.**\r\n* Players can designate a custom AFK message, which will be displayed to users mentioning them (and optionally broadcast to the server when they go AFK, if broadcastGlobally is enabled)\r\n* Players are automatically set back to available when they return to the game - there's no need to remember to run a command\r\n* Several command aliases are available, should there be any incompatibilities with existing plugins.\r\n\r\nAlertAFK was built as light-weight as possible, but this is still my first relatively comprehensive plugin (code-wise; the user interaction is, of course, extremely simple :)), so it may be inefficient in some aspects. Please feel free to [suggest changes](https://github.com/rmsy/AlertAFK/pulls) if you think something could be better - in fact, I encourage you to. (What fun is open-source, community-driven software if only one person is writing it?)\r\n\r\nAlertAFK is entirely [open-source](https://github.com/rmsy/AlertAFK), and is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. Here's what that means for you:\r\n* Feel free to do **whatever you want** with AlertAFK\r\n* Feel free to share AlertAFK with **whoever you want**\r\nbut:\r\n* Don't sell it.\r\n* Don't license anything using AlertAFK with a more restricting license.\r\n\r\n**I believe in open software, and I believe in freedom of information. Let's use it responsibly and be an example to the world.**\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis is the usage for AlertAFK:\r\n\r\n```/<command> [optional AFK message]```\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s it. These are the commands:\r\n* /afk\r\n* /a\r\n* /away\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\nThere are currently only two values in AlertAFK's configuration file. There is **broadcastGlobally**, defaulting to false, which defines whether or not to broadcast to the entire server when a user goes AFK or becomes available again, and **defaultAfkMessage**, which is the default AFK message to be provided, should the user not provide one. The configuration file will be generated on first-run, you do not need to create it manually.\r\n\r\n**Note:** AlertAFK makes use of Hidendra's [Griefcraft Metrics](http://metrics.griefcraft.com/). These statistics are entirely anonymous, and do not affect performance in any way. **These statistics help me to get an idea of who's using AlertAFK and how, but I respect your right to privacy - should you wish to disable these usage statistics, please opt-out in the PluginMetrics/config.yml file, generated on first-run.**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
