<h3>What is AlertAFK?</h3>

<p><strong>AlertAFK allows players to designate themselves as AFK, so that other players talking to them in chat are notified that they are not available.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players can designate a custom AFK message, which will be displayed to users mentioning them (and optionally broadcast to the server when they go AFK, if broadcastGlobally is enabled)</li>
<li>Players are automatically set back to available when they return to the game - there's no need to remember to run a command</li>
<li>Several command aliases are available, should there be any incompatibilities with existing plugins.</li>
</ul><p>AlertAFK was built as light-weight as possible, but this is still my first relatively comprehensive plugin (code-wise; the user interaction is, of course, extremely simple :)), so it may be inefficient in some aspects. Please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/rmsy/AlertAFK/pulls">suggest changes</a> if you think something could be better - in fact, I encourage you to. (What fun is open-source, community-driven software if only one person is writing it?)</p>

<p>AlertAFK is entirely <a href="https://github.com/rmsy/AlertAFK">open-source</a>, and is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. Here's what that means for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Feel free to do <strong>whatever you want</strong> with AlertAFK</li>
<li>Feel free to share AlertAFK with <strong>whoever you want</strong>
but:</li>
<li>Don't sell it.</li>
<li>Don't license anything using AlertAFK with a more restricting license.</li>
</ul><p><strong>I believe in open software, and I believe in freedom of information. Let's use it responsibly and be an example to the world.</strong></p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>This is the usage for AlertAFK:</p>

<p><code>/&lt;command&gt; [optional AFK message]</code></p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it. These are the commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>/afk</li>
<li>/a</li>
<li>/away</li>
</ul><h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>There are currently only two values in AlertAFK's configuration file. There is <strong>broadcastGlobally</strong>, defaulting to false, which defines whether or not to broadcast to the entire server when a user goes AFK or becomes available again, and <strong>defaultAfkMessage</strong>, which is the default AFK message to be provided, should the user not provide one. The configuration file will be generated on first-run, you do not need to create it manually.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> AlertAFK makes use of Hidendra's <a href="http://metrics.griefcraft.com/">Griefcraft Metrics</a>. These statistics are entirely anonymous, and do not affect performance in any way. <strong>These statistics help me to get an idea of who's using AlertAFK and how, but I respect your right to privacy - should you wish to disable these usage statistics, please opt-out in the PluginMetrics/config.yml file, generated on first-run.</strong></p>
